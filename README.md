Recommendation for You Right Now
Since you already have an AI API and want it today:

Sign up for HeyGen Streaming Avatars (they have a free trial + $29/mo starter).
Use LiveKit (free tier 50 k minutes) or Daily.co as the video backend.
Plug in Deepgram + Groq/OpenAI + ElevenLabs Turbo.
Replace Zoom entirely — give candidates a simple link to your custom page with your AI avatar.

You’ll have a fully custom, real-time speaking AI interviewer that looks and sounds better than 99 % of the commercial tools — in under a weekend.
Want me to send you a complete GitHub repo template (Python + HeyGen + LiveKit) that you can deploy in one click? Just say the word.
